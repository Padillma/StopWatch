## Dev Notes
the main purpose of this project is to create an java application using SCRUM Agile.
I am also implementing git and JUnit testing. This will be considered my first Sprint.
After all requirements are complete, the sprint will be done. Requirements may be added or removed before final review.

### Transition into 2nd Sprint
JUnit testing will be moved to the start of 2nd Sprint. Mainly to practice testing techniques.

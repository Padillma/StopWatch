## STOPWATCH

## OBJECTIVE
  To create a stopwatch java application. It can be simple as possible. It just needs to show a Timer, Start button and Reset button.
  It needs to be visible and easy to read. The window size does not have to cover the entire screen.
  
## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Timer. (format: HH:MM:SS)  -- H:Hour M:Minute S:Seconds
2. Start Button. Timer starts as soon as the User presses it.
3. Reset Button. Timer stops and resets back to ZERO. must press start to begin timer again.
4. Window. must contain everything and not be to big or small.

## UNFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Readability. 
2. Visability. Product Owner just needs simple design
3. Timer needs to have a larger font size
4. Button highlights when user is over either button.
5. Timer is at Zero when app opens.

## Dev Notes
the main purpose of this project. it is made to create an actual java application using SCRUM Agile.
Im also impleteing git and JUnit testing. This will be considered my first Sprint.
After all requirements are complete, will the sprint be done. Requirements may be added or removed before final review.

## Second sprint
We now have a fully functional timer application. Owner is now asking for a lap feature, which is needing a new button and lap times. Client is wanting lap times to be in a list format underneath the timer and buttons. He is also wanting the best and worst lap times to be in a different color. needing timer, and other information to be increase/decrease in size when window size is changed by the user. 

NEW REQUIREMENTS

FUNC. 
1. display adjusts size with window
2. recording of laptimes
3. implementing a list of laptimes underneath timer and buttons
4. lap button - to make the entire gui more 'attractive', might make reset and lap button in one(need client approval)

UNFUNC.
1. Green font color for best lap time and red for the worst
2. lap times can be name Lap 1, Lap 2, Lap 3, etc. but in decending order
3. changing the favicon for the window.
